source `Milnor/Chapter3/Step1.lean`, copied from the version of 2026-10-01.

Changes against the source: the namespace `Milnor` is renamed to `Polyfold.MilnorSard` (so that
a later real dependency on the Milnor library cannot clash), the imports `Milnor.Chapter1.*` and
`Milnor.Chapter3.*` are replaced by `Polyfold.Vendor.MilnorSard.*`, and qualified references
`Milnor.foo` by `Polyfold.MilnorSard.foo`.  No statement or proof is changed.

# Step 1: `f(C ∖ C₁)` has measure zero

> This first step is perhaps the hardest. […] We will need the well known theorem of Fubini which
> asserts that a measurable set `A ⊆ ℝᵖ = ℝ¹ × ℝᵖ⁻¹` must have measure zero if it intersects each
> hyperplane `(constant) × ℝᵖ⁻¹` in a set of `(p-1)`-dimensional measure zero.
>
> For each `x̄ ∈ C ∖ C₁` we will find an open neighborhood `V ⊆ ℝⁿ` so that `f(V ∩ C)` has
> measure zero. […] Since `x̄ ∉ C₁`, there is some partial derivative, say `∂f₁/∂x₁`, which is
> not zero at `x̄`. Consider the map `h(x) = (f₁(x), x₂, …, xₙ)`. Since `dh_x̄` is nonsingular, `h`
> maps some neighborhood `V` of `x̄` diffeomorphically onto an open set `V'`. The composition
> `g = f ∘ h⁻¹` will then map `V'` into `ℝᵖ`. Note that the set `C'` of critical points of `g` is
> precisely `h(V ∩ C)`; hence the set `g(C')` of critical values of `g` is equal to `f(V ∩ C)`.
>
> For each `(t, x₂, …, xₙ) ∈ V'` note that `g(t, x₂, …, xₙ)` belongs to the hyperplane
> `t × ℝᵖ⁻¹ ⊆ ℝᵖ`: thus `g` carries hyperplanes into hyperplanes. Let `gᵗ` denote the restriction
> of `g` to `(t × ℝⁿ⁻¹) ∩ V'`. Note that a point of `t × ℝⁿ⁻¹` is critical for `gᵗ` if and only if
> it is critical for `g`; for the matrix of first derivatives of `g` has the form
> `[1 0; * ∂gᵗᵢ/∂xⱼ]`. According to the induction hypothesis, the set of critical values of `gᵗ` has
> measure zero in `t × ℝᵖ⁻¹`. Therefore the set of critical values of `g` intersects each
> hyperplane `t × ℝᵖ⁻¹` in a set of measure zero. This set `g(C')` is measurable, since it can
> be expressed as a countable union of compact subsets. Hence, by Fubini's theorem, the set
> `g(C') = f(V ∩ C)` has measure zero.

Coordinate-free version. Choose `ℓ₀ : F → ℝ` with `ℓ₀(df_x̄(u)) ≠ 0`, put `w = ℓ₀ ∘ f` (Milnor's
`f₁`) and straighten `w` (`Straightening`): `H : V → V' ⊆ ℝ × K`, `G = H⁻¹`. Split `F = ℝ × F₁`
along `ℓ₀` with `F₁ = ker ℓ₀`, via `e(y) = (ℓ₀(y), Q(y))`. Then `g = f ∘ G` satisfies
`ℓ₀ ∘ g = fst` on `V'`, and `gᵗ = Q ∘ g(t, ·) : K → F₁`. The block-matrix remark becomes
`e ∘ dg_{(t,z)} (s, u) = (s, ∗ + d(gᵗ)_z u)`, so `dg` is onto iff `d(gᵗ)` is (`hcrit` below). We
take `V` to be a closed ball, so that `f(C ∩ V)` is compact, hence measurable, and Milnor's
"countable union of compact subsets" is not needed.
