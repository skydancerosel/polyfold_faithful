source `Milnor/Chapter3/Basic.lean`, copied from the version of 2026-10-01.

Changes against the source: the namespace `Milnor` is renamed to `Polyfold.MilnorSard` (so that
a later real dependency on the Milnor library cannot clash), the imports `Milnor.Chapter1.*` and
`Milnor.Chapter3.*` are replaced by `Polyfold.Vendor.MilnorSard.*`, and qualified references
`Milnor.foo` by `Polyfold.MilnorSard.foo`.  No statement or proof is changed.

# Setup for Sard's theorem

> **Theorem of Sard.** Let `f : U → ℝᵖ` be a smooth map, with `U` open in `ℝⁿ`, and let `C` be the
> set of critical points; that is the set of all `x ∈ U` with `rank dfₓ < p`. Then `f(C) ⊆ ℝᵖ`
> has measure zero.

This file sets up the objects in Milnor's proof, for maps `f : E → F` between finite-dimensional
real normed spaces (so that the induction on `n = dim E` can pass to subspaces without
choosing coordinates):

* `critSet f U`, Milnor's `C`: the points of `U` where `dfₓ` is not surjective;
* `vanishSet f U k`, Milnor's `Cₖ`: the points of `U` where all derivatives of order `1, …, k`
  vanish;
* `SardStatement n`: the statement of Sard's theorem for all domains of dimension `n`, all
  targets, and all Haar measures on the target. Milnor proves it by induction on `n`.

It also proves two facts Milnor uses without comment:

* the critical set is closed in `U`, because "`dfₓ` is surjective" is an open condition on the
  linear map `dfₓ` (`isOpen_setOf_surjective`); Milnor uses this on p. 18 ("this set is
  measurable, since it can be expressed as a countable union of compact subsets");
* a set of Hausdorff dimension less than `dim F` has Haar measure zero
  (`addHaar_eq_zero_of_dimH_lt_finrank`). This replaces Milnor's cube-counting in Step 3.
