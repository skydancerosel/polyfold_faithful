Vendored from the Milnor project of `github.com/skydancerosel/math_faithful`:
source `Milnor/Chapter3/Sard.lean`, copied from the version of 2026-10-01.

Changes against the source: the namespace `Milnor` is renamed to `Polyfold.MilnorSard` (so that
a later real dependency on the Milnor library cannot clash), the imports `Milnor.Chapter1.*` and
`Milnor.Chapter3.*` are replaced by `Polyfold.Vendor.MilnorSard.*`, and qualified references
`Milnor.foo` by `Polyfold.MilnorSard.foo`.  No statement or proof is changed.

# Sard's theorem

> **Theorem of Sard.** Let `f : U → ℝᵖ` be a smooth map, with `U` open in `ℝⁿ`, and let `C` be the
> set of critical points; that is the set of all `x ∈ U` with `rank dfₓ < p`. Then `f(C) ⊆ ℝᵖ` has
> measure zero.

The proof is by induction on `n` (Milnor p. 16): "To start the induction, the theorem is
certainly true for `n = 0`", and for `n ≥ 1` the set `C` is the union of `C ∖ C₁`, the sets
`Cᵢ ∖ Cᵢ₊₁` for `1 ≤ i < k`, and `Cₖ`, whose images are null by Steps 1, 2, 3 respectively.
Steps 1 and 2 use the induction hypothesis in dimension `n - 1`; Step 3 does not.

Two small points that Milnor leaves implicit:
* if the target is zero-dimensional, every linear map onto it is surjective, so `C = ∅` and there
  is nothing to prove; this case has to be treated separately because a Haar measure on a
  zero-dimensional space is a point mass, not the zero measure;
* the case `n = 0` needs the target to be nontrivial, so that points have measure zero.

We also record Milnor's remark on p. 10: "Since a set of measure zero cannot contain any
nonvacuous open set, it follows that the complement `ℝᵖ ∖ f(C)` must be everywhere dense."
